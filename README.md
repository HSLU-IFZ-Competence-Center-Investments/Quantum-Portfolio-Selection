# Grover Search for Portfolio Selection

We present explicit oracles designed to be used in
Groverâ€™s algorithm to match investor preferences. Specifically, the
oracles select portfolios with returns and standard deviations
exceeding and falling below certain thresholds, respectively. One
potential use case for the oracles is selecting portfolios with the
best Sharpe ratios. We have implemented these algorithms using
quantum simulators.
